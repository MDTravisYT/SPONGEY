Parser Generator is a Windows based YACC and Lex IDE. It is a Shareware 
program and can be freely distributed providing it is done so in its 
entirety. It includes two custom versions of YACC and Lex called AYACC 
and ALex respectively. They have had a few modifications, some of which 
are listed below.

Features
Below are some of the features that are provided by Parser Generator: 

1) Project management facility.
2) Project rebuild mechanism, including Output window and error mapping 
to source files.
3) Full editor including YACC and Lex syntax colouring.
4) YACC can generate LALR(1), CLR(1) and SLR(1) parsers.
5) C and C++ code generation.
6) Lex can deal successfully with the '\0' character.
7) A Library now holds most of the table driving code.
8) YACC and Lex can generate either fast or compact parsers/lexical 
analysers.
9) YACC and Lex can generate multiple parsers/lexical analysers for 
inclusion in a single executable.
10) Parsers can now perform clean up during error recovery. When a 
symbol is popped off of the stack, or a lookahead token is discarded, an 
action can be called. This is useful if, for instance, you are building 
a node tree.
